      <h1>Referee your matches!</h1>
       <h2> <em>"A competition without refereeing is only a figment"</em></h2>
        <p>
         What could be nicer to play a match where you can stay in your own bubble without having to worry about counting games, points... Same for clubs, what a relief to organize tournaments, team matches without having to worry about the good progress of the matches. Because that's what referees are there for! We are the guarantors of the image of the club where the match takes place and of the players. With us, our dear viewers and players will enjoy the match. Make the rackets talk!
        </p>
       <h2> <em>"Pacifying quarrels and disputes by arbitration".</em></h2>
        <p>
          Alala... Remember that opponent two years ago who stole the match from you by only cheating on your good balls? Unfortunately, you could only contest by asking for the point to be put back. Or the one not long ago who was freaking out every time he lost a point. You could also only protect yourself with your racket from any killing throw or hope that he doesn't stab you at every change of side. We all have these players in mind that we don't want to meet again on the circuit... Well with us, the referees, it's STOP! No more need to check on the other side of the court to see if your ball is 5 millimeters out, to panic when you can't find the ball after calling a foul or to constantly have doubts about the honesty of your opponent. We are here for you: the voice of wisdom we will have and impartial we will be.
